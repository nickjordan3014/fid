  <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Nick Jordan and I'm a student at Seminole State College
    and a future student at UCF. I'm majoring in Web Design and minoring in Information Technology. I have
    mastered many different Adobe programs, Microsoft programs, and I have coding experience in HTML, Python, and CSS.
    Some of my future goals include becoming a professional webdesigner and/or a professional video editor.</p>

  <p>Some of my hobbies include gaming and watching/reviewing TV shows and movies. My favorite video games
  include the Pokemon series, Mario Kart, GTA, and Minecraft. The TV shows I enjoy include many DC
  shows like Arrow, Flash and Young Justice. My favorite movies are the MCU, Star Wars, and Pirates of the
  Caribbean series.</p>

    on some of my skills and how I've put them into use. The software tab contains software that I know how to use
    and what the software can be used for. The Work Gallery and Website Portfolio include different examples of things I
