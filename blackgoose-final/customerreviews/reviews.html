<hr class="new1">
<p>Blackgoose is a wonderful establishment with excellent service. Personally, their brick oven-style pizza is my favorite menu item. Perfection in every bite. 9.5/10<br>~ Joel M.</p>
<p>Food was superb! The only disappointment was that they ran out of donuts with red, white and blue sprinkles :(<br>~ Steve R.</p>
<p>The Schwarma was amazing! I would come here after saving the world anyday. Also eating the last donut with red, white, and blue sprinkles was a great feeling. 10/10<br>~ Tony S.
<p>The food was okay... My Spaghetti Tacos are better than this place though. 5/10<br>~ Spencer S.
